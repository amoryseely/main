This folder should contain the images used by the site.

Place two images with these filenames:


- `hero-water.jpg`  -> large hero image (recommended: 1600x900 or wider)
- `water-tap.jpg`   -> secondary strip image (recommended: 1200x600)

If you don't have images yet, you can use any placeholder images and the site will still render.
