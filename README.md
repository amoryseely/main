# main

This repository contains a small static website scaffold: an accessible hero
page with a donate call-to-action.

Files added:

- `index.html` — main page
- `styles.css` — site styles
- `images/README.txt` — instructions for adding images

Quick local preview:

Run a simple HTTP server in the project root and open http://localhost:8000

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Add two images to the `images/` folder named `hero-water.jpg` and `water-tap.jpg`.
The layout will use those images as backgrounds for the hero and image strip.

Want changes or alternate styling? Tell me what you want next (fonts, colors,
or a donate form) and I will update the files.
